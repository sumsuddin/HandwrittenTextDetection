# Single Character Images (Legacy)
- 2613 images

The images were already pre-processed by Sobel edge normalization, grayscaled, 64x64px size and saved as flatten array. They may not be so useful due to different normalization. More lettere images can be obtained form words with gaplines. The images are part of my dataset archive:

The `en-data.csv` contains values of individual pixels of images and `en-labels.csv` contains corresponding characters.

### CZ Characters
2 * 42 - upper, lower alphabet with accents (without ch and Ch); plus null char
    = 83 characters
### EN chars
2 * 26 - upper, lower alphabet; plus null char
    = 53 characters
